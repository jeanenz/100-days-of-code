# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Free Code Camp stuff - finished Accessability and Responsivie Design sections plus started on Flexbox.

**Thoughts:** It's been a while since I have been on https://www.freecodecamp.org/.  I'm glad to be back and surprised how much progress I made in only an hour. Looking forward to getting to the projects soon!
