The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 15, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on Free Code Camp stuff - finished Accessability and Responsivie Design sections plus started on Flexbox.

### R1D2
Finished Flexbox and Grid in FreeCodeCamp.  Started to revise my old tribute page to remove Bootstrap.

### R1D3
R1D3 of my #100DaysOfCode. Completed my tribute page on #freeCodeCamp! https://codepen.io/jeanenz/full/mGGjwY/ â€¦ Onward to the Survey Form project tomorrow.

### R1D4
Skipped a day yesterday, but I'm back today. Started on the next FCC project - Survey form. Got the HTML text in place, then noticed the vast number of divs in the example one. Ugg. Lots of typing to come.

### R1D5
Skipped several days (it's now 9/26 not 9/19). Finished my survey form on #freeCodeCamp using CSS Grid and variables - cool stuff! Didn't use any floats, either. https://codepen.io/jeanenz/full/EdYjRg/
